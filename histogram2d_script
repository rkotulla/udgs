#I am trying to figure out how to write the histogram script with git; if this is me doing it wrong, I'm sorry

#draft script for 2d histogram of 1367 final catalog data

#calling all the libraries

from numpy import c_
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random


#Data defining

#some way to open and read the .vot of galfit2? and maybe an if statement
# to select only those points with proper SERSIC_ER?

catalog = /sas2/reu2019sara/abell1367/combined_galfit2.vot

lim = (catalog['SERSIC_ER'])
y = (catalog['DELTA_J2000'])
x = (catalog['ALPHA_J2000'])


#doing plotting

#would it be best to have a limiting if statement before plotting
#or to have a limiting if statement write another catalog??

if lim > 15:
    plt.hist2d(x,y, bins = 50)
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.title("Abell 1367 Density Plot")

    plt.savefig('abell1367_density_practice.png', bbox_inches = 'tight')
    plt.close()

#this is not done
